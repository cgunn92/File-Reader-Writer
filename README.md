# File-Reader-Writer
This was my final project in my Object Oriented Programming class

The FinalProj.py file holds the main portion of the code in which the read.txt file will be read and manipulated.
The resulting text will then be written to a new file called writes.txt.

FinalTest.py tests FinalProj.py to verify that it works properly.
